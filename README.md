# CodeDoesGood - Organization Website

### Intro

This project is split into 2 main sections:
 1. **legacy**: this is backing our current [org website](http://codedoesgood.org); and
 2. **nuxt-project**: is where our future work is being held, which is not set in stone yet which framework we are going to use, but potentially `Next.js` instead of `Nuxt.js`.

### Legacy project

The [legacy](legacy) project is an Express.js App, using `swig` views to render our HTML files, with a very minimal and straightforward folder structure for our routes.

### Future `Nuxt.js` (or `Next.js`)

The future project is currently based on `Nuxt.js` under [nuxt-project](nuxt-project); We've considered switching over to `Next.js` before development starts -- mainly because of community support.

> _i.e. `Next.js` (https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) is based on React, and `Nuxt.js` (https://nuxtjs.org/) is based on `Vue.js`_
