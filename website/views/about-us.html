            <h2>Our Story</h2>

            <p>CodeDoesGood was founded by 4 developers in Vancouver, BC Canada. Four skin tones, four races, four nationalities, four languages, four very different life experiences.</p>
            <p>Our compiled life experiences mean at least one of us has first-hand experience of poverty, mental health issues, wildlife rescue, racism, international schooling, community arts, natural disasters, landing as a refugee, education, suicide, multi-ethnic families, fleeing violence, protesting, learning a new language, physical rehabilitation, immigration, ecological issues...</p>
            <p>We have each seen and understood the world in individual ways and we each have different motivating values but deep down we do share one common goal: <strong>To Do Good</strong></p>
            <p>We saw two great problems, one in the world at large and one in the tech community.</p>
            <p>The first problem we saw was that the high cost of software was eliminating technological solutions for volunteer-run organizations and those with low operating budgets. The people that run these groups are so driven they find a way to make a penny stretch a mile, but without technical volunteers to tap into, those pennies just can't stretch that far when it comes to software.</p>
            <p>The second problem we saw was that the tech community at large is decrying the lack of experienced developers while an abundance of new developers are left flapping around like fish out of water with no guidance and no clear way to make the leap to become that experienced developer that everyone wants.</p>

            <h3>Synchronicity</h3>
            <p>It seemed a rather obvious connection. Together these two problems are no longer problems but are instead each other's solutions. Rather than focussing on how to solve one, or the other, we realized that we need only to build a framework for these two issues to intersect and great things would happen!</p>
